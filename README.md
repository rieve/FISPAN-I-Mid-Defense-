# FISPAN-I-Mid-Defense-
This is the intital phase of Finger Spelling Communication Platform for NSL using AI-Neural Network (FISPAN). This file contains a LSTM based model that captures data va webcam, trains it via LSTM and detects the sign in real time. 
Here the model is only trained for 'ka', 'Sunday', 'Red', 'Father', and 'one'. However more signs and number of data cillected could be increased all time.
Donot forget ot install the necessary libraries mentioned in installment.txt before running the code.
